# avoid-the-falling-objects-game

I found this game when I was trying to apply to be a volunteer at
[Code In The Community](https://www.codeinthecommunity.com/) where they teach
kids to do programming with Scratch and Python

They provided challenges for folks applying to volunteer. The two challenges -

The text version of the Scratch Challenge is below -

Write a Scratch program to implement a "Avoid the Falling Objects" game. The
player has to avoid the falling objects for a stipulated amount of time in
order to win. The player dies once they collide with any falling object.

Requirements:

- Create a sprite to be controlled by either the mouse
- Generate falling objects (clones) from top
- Check for collision with object
- Add time survival variable
- Add ending screen for when game is over
- Additional Challenges (Optional)
  - Add chance/player life variable
  - Add instructions for the game

I have created the game with the above features. More cool features could be
added too! :)
